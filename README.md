# Music-Band-Project
Within this project, we've developed a web-based interactive application that lets users interact with a range of musical instruments. You can play the guitar and drums, and enjoy the feel of a rock band on your web browser.You can simply click on different parts to trigger sounds associated with that specific area of the instrument
